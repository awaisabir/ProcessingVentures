# ProcessingVentures

This is my journey in Processing 2.0. A language I picked up during my first year at Carleton University. Not all of projects are top-notch. This repository displays basic projects that I worked on during my first year. Some of the projects are not finished, and I will update the repository with the finished versions when I finish them. But in the meantime, feel free to take a ride through my Processing ventures!
